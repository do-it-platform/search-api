I have a lawnmower and a rake, please bring your own working gloves, if necessary. For the whole lawn i offer 50 EUR.",

You should play with him and make some sandwiches for dinner. Our neighbour will be around, if you need help. We offer 15 EUR per hour.",
            "I broke my leg two days ago and need someone to walk my dog tonight around 7 p.m. It’s a Husky so he needs long walks (1-2 hours every day). He is lovely and well trained If you are available and interested, contact me and we will talk about the payment.",
            "We need someone to play Santa for our 3-year-old daughter on December 24th between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. We will give you the gifts in advance. You should eat some cookies and drink the milk (both outside on the porch) and then come in to place the gifts under the tree. Maybe you could say \"Ho-ho-ho!\" or something, but let’s talk about the details on the phone. Contact us, if you are interested. We pay well!",

We want to surprise him with a clown who knows some tricks like juggling or riding a unicycle. If you are interested and available please contact us. The party starts at 2 p.m. so if you could be there around 3 p.m. for 2 or 3 hours would be great! Hourly pay: 15 EUR.",
            "My grandma needs your help! Usually I run her errands, but I’m sick at home and not able to get outside for a long shopping trip. So you should come by my house and I will give you all the information you need to run the errands and bring them to my grandma’s house. It should happen this week and should not take longer than 3 hours. I pay you 20 EUR for the whole thing.",
            "Who can give my 3 daughters a proper haircut? Because the hairdresser is way to expensive and the girls won’t let me cut their hair since I cut them way to short last time, I need someone who has experience in cutting hair. I offer 10 EUR per haircut!"
